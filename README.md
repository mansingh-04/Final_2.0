FileOrganizer
FileOrganizer is a macOS desktop application that helps you organize files in a folder by their file types. The application sorts your files into separate subfolders based on their extensions (e.g., .txt, .jpg, etc.).

Prerequisites
macOS 10.10 (Yosemite) or later
No installation required. Simply download and run the .dmg file.
Steps to Install and Run the Application
Step 1
Download the File_2.0 folder from this link.

Step 2
Open the folder and double-click the File_Manager.dmg file.
Wait for it to open. The application will automatically open the browser and redirect you to the link: 
http://127.0.0.1:5000.
If the file doesn’t open, go to System Preferences > Privacy & Security, and allow the app to run by giving it the necessary permissions.

Note:

The first time the app opens, it may take a little longer as it installs the required files on your system.
Step 3

Enter the folder path: Provide the path of the folder containing the files you want to organize. The application will work with any folder you provide (ensure the folder exists).
Example folder path: /Users/username/Documents/Downloads

Click on "Clean Folder": The app will organize your files by creating subfolders named after each file type (e.g., TXT Files, JPG Files, etc.), and move the files accordingly.

Completion
Once the process is complete, a message will appear on the screen confirming that the folder has been successfully cleaned.
